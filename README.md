# xmas23
This is the first full-stack project I have created outside of class assignments and projects. this project has security issues and it is not suggested to run this on your personal computer this is only for portfolio purposes.

This project has been developed on my Personal Computer in November of 2022. I did not have the knowledge of using a docker container to create a project that can install the essential back ends like PSQL and all of the necessary Python libraries and modules.

I found the CSS code on the internet and altered it. If you are the designer of this style please email me at divanebeigip@gmail.com so I can put your name on this repository.
